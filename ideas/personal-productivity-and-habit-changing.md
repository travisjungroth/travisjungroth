# Personal Productivity and Habit Changing
## Description
### Problem
I've hacked together a system for productivity, learning and habit change using Todoist, Airtable, Zapier and Anki. I like it more than any off-the-shelf solution, which is weird.
### Possible Solutions
Basecamp for personal productivity and habit changing. Also using a spaced repetition component on habits.
