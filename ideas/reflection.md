# Reflection
## Description
### Problem
I’m not sure how good I am at following through on things, and I’d like to be better. I think as an individual and as organizations, we come up with these big plans but don’t look backwards to decide if they were right or we even did them.

### Possible Solutions
Record what you want to do this day/week/month/year, then score yourself at the end of the period on two categories: did you do it and was it the right thing to do?
