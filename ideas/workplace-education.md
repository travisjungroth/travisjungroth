# Workplace Education
## Description
### Problem
Getting everyone at a company to know something is really slow and expensive. People generally don’t know the right thing much of the time. [Much more detail below.](/ideas/workplace-education#more-thoughts).
### Possible Solutions
Knowledge deployment software. Have everyone at your company know the things they should. Spaced repetition component.

## More Thoughts
One mental model that’s useful for office work is to consider at the root of everything a worker does is information. Nearly all tasks are based on information, not physical abilities. A worker can be considered to have two parts: the internal and the external. The internal is their body and mind. 

There is not much to be done directly to the body. The mind is where they operate from. The external is all the resources they have available to them. The worker must have the knowledge that these resources exist and the knowledge of how to use them.

The only information that a worker has available to them all of the time is what’s in their mind. For all external information, they must know that it exists and how to find it.
“
Workplace communication” is the act of updating information, specifically what’s in the mind of workers. To use programming terms, you can create, read or update (deletion is not yet possible).
External information is what they have available to them.

- Documentation
- Recordings of meetings
- Old emails
- Saved chats
- Information in the minds of others

Inside their mind are two types of information

- Actual information
- Where to find information

When someone is met with a demand for information (most likely “what is the correct action here”) they may:

- Know the information
- Know where to find the information
- Know where to find the information about where to find the information (or an even longer chain)

All of these also have failure modes

- Know the wrong information
- Not know the information
- Not know where to find the information about where to find the information
- Not know that a demand for information has even occurred

There are two demands placed on the worker: recognize a demand for information has occurred and have a path to the information available to them.

But what about group work? Collaboration? All knowledge work is inherently individual. No one has direct access to the mind of the other. All we can do is influence their mind by affecting their experience (writing, talking, expressions) and allow our experience to be altered by them (reading, listening, looking).

Workplace attempts to change internal information have much room for improvement. They attempt to create information that isn’t needed. They don’t provide information when it is needed. They fail to notify about updates in external information.

- Workers need less internal information than is being put in there
- Reference invalidation is usually more useful than updates. I don’t need to know the new information, I just need to know that the old information is wrong and where to find the new information
- Information that does need to be internalized isn’t actually
    - Think of your last company email with a piece of information everyone “needs to know”. A week later, what percentage of employees could answer that information on a test? Either the update operation failed and there were damages or it wasn’t needed in the first place
- Information updates could happen in batches and with less interruption
- Demands for information could happen with less interruption
- Important information updates need to happen with much higher confidence

Shallow vs. deep work.

- Little must be in-mind
- Things that are in-mind require repetition and testing
- Information chains must be kept updated
- It is expensive to have other people’s minds in information chains
- Little must be updated immediately
