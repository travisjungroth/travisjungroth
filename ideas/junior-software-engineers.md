# Junior Software Engineers
## Description
### Problem
It's really hard for new software engineers to contribute to existing projects, whether they're working at a company or want to contribute to open source. 

### Possible Solutions
An app that pulls off junior level tasks and manages their workflow so they can happen in parallel to other tasks. The first would be converting manual QA tickets to automated tests.
