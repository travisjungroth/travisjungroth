# Junior Software Engineers
## Description
### Problem
It's really hard for new software engineers to contribute to existing projects, whether they're working at a company or want to contribute to open source. 

### Possible Solutions
An app that pulls off junior level tasks and manages their workflow so they can happen in parallel to other tasks. The first would be converting manual QA tickets to automated tests.

## Evaluation
The scorecards below are explained [here](/scorecards-explained).

### Additional
#### Who desperately needs this product?
Junior software engineers who aren't sure how to contribute. Software companies that want to increase development speed without increasing total costs.

#### Am I the target user, know them extremely well, or neither?
I was the target user, I know them extremely well, and as when I grow a startup I will be the target user (from the other side).

#### Is this designed and created to grow very quickly?
Yes.

## Seven questions from Zero to One
### The Engineering Question 
#### Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
Yes. This space is dominated by really simple crud apps. While I want to start with simple workflow management, I had ideas for pushing past that.

### The Timing Question
#### Is now the right time to start your particular business? 
Yes. Isolation and economic upset mean more people looking for a new job, and many will choose now to make the jump to software. The supply is there and if we can open up the demand side it will be huge.

### The Monopoly Question
#### Are you starting with a big share of a small market? 
No. Not small enough. I need to slice it down more. Maybe recent bootcamp grads in the US, or self-taught software engineers.

### The People Question 
#### Do you have the right team? 
No. I'm solo and a good match for the problem, but I need cofounders.
    
### The Distribution Question
#### Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
Yes. Start with a version for open source to get mindshare.

### The Durability Question 
####  Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
Yes. The market isn't going anywhere. And we can get network and lock-in effects as the way for junior devs to break in.

###  The Secret Question
#### Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?
Yes. Almost every project I've seen for helping junior software engineers is just focused on teaching. They need a chance to work.
