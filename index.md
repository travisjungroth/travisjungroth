# I'm looking for cofounders

If you'd like to talk about starting a startup or know someone who would, email me at jungroth@gmail.com or just throw something on [my calendar](https://calendly.com/travisjungroth/30min).

## Problems I'm interested in

### Workplace education
How do you efficiently change behavior at work?

### Personal productivity and habit changing
I've hacked together a system for productivity, learning and habit change using Todoist, Airtable, Zapier and Anki. I like it more than any off-the-shelf solution, which is weird. 

### Workplace communication
I think workplace communication is bad and getting worse, not better. 

### Getting income share agreements to everyone
ISAs are the future and they're not nearly as big as they should be.

### Many more
Whatever you've identified as a problem, I'm probably sympathetic. 

## What I'm doing right now
I'm writing this from Seattle, and then I'll be in a Mexico City from Jan 11 to at least the end of February. Now that I'm over the dengue fever I caught in December, I'm exploring interesting ideas full time.

## What I'm looking for
Cofounders who want to work on interesting stuff together to both test and build professional relationships. I'm also just happy to chat on a quick video call. 

## Stuff I like
### Technology
 * Python
 * Django
 * Z3
 * Heroku

### Activities
 * Scuba
 * Weightlifting
 
## Things I've done
