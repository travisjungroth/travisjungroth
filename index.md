# I'm looking for cofounders

If you'd like to talk about starting a startup or know someone who would, email me at [jungroth@gmail.com](mailto:jungroth@gmail.com) or just throw something on [my calendar](https://calendly.com/travisjungroth/30min).

## Ideas I'm interested in

### [Creating Test Data](http://travisjungroth.com/ideas/creating-test-data)
Creating test data for manual QA is hard but could be really easy.

### [Workplace Education](http://travisjungroth.com/ideas/workplace-education)
How do you efficiently change behavior at work?

### [Personal Productivity and Habit Changing](http://travisjungroth.com/ideas/personal-productivity-and-habit-changing)
I've hacked together a system for productivity, learning and habit change using Todoist, Airtable, Zapier and Anki. I like it more than any off-the-shelf solution, which is weird. 

### Workplace communication
I think workplace communication is bad and getting worse, not better. 

### Getting income share agreements to everyone
ISAs are the future and they're not nearly as big as they should be.

### Many more
Whatever you've identified as a problem, I'm probably sympathetic. 

## What I'm doing right now
I'm living in Mexico City and exploring interesting ideas full time.

## What I'm looking for
Cofounders who want to work on interesting stuff together to both test and build professional relationships. I'm also just happy to chat on a quick video call. 

## Stuff I like
### Technology
 * Python

### Activities

## Things I've done
