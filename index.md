# I'm looking for cofounders

If you'd like to talk about starting a startup or know someone who would, email me at [jungroth@gmail.com](mailto:jungroth@gmail.com) or just throw something on [my calendar](https://calendly.com/travisjungroth/30min).

## Ideas I'm interested in
### [Workplace Education](/ideas/workplace-education)
How do you efficiently change behavior at work?

### [Creating Test Data](/ideas/creating-test-data)
Creating test data for manual QA is hard but could be really easy.

### [Personal Productivity and Habit Changing](/ideas/personal-productivity-and-habit-changing)
I've hacked together a system for productivity, learning and habit change using Todoist, Airtable, Zapier and Anki. I like it more than any off-the-shelf solution, which is weird. 

### [Workplace Communication](/ideas/workplace-communication)
I think workplace communication is bad and getting worse.

### [Reflection](/ideas/reflection)
Did we do what we planned and was it the right thing to do?

### [Income Share Agreements for Everyone](/ideas/income-share-agreements-for-everyone)
ISAs are the future and they're not nearly as big as they should be.

### Many more
Whatever you've identified as a problem, I'm probably sympathetic. 

## What I'm doing right now
I'm living in Mexico City and exploring interesting ideas full time.

## What I'm looking for
Cofounders who want to work on interesting stuff together to both test and build professional relationships. I'm also just happy to chat on a quick video call.
