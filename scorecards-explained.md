# Scorecards Explained
The scorecards I've made are based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOtCl5PU8F0). Every score is just my own opinion, which varies from pretty informed to not at all.

### Problem
I took the attributes he describes for a great startup, then added my own "terrible", "bad", and "good" values. The checkmark is for what value I think applies to this idea. Metrics explained:

 * Popular: How many people have this problem.
 * Growing: Annual growth rate of the problem.
 * Urgent: How soon this problem needs to be fixed.
 * Expensive: The annual cost of this problem.
 * Mandatory: How much this problem needs solving.
 * Frequent: How often this problem occurs.
 
 ### Insight
 These are the insight metrics from the video. For each metric, I'm scoring what I think the likelihood that my solution will have each of these unfair advantages.
 
  * Founders 1 in 10: Am I one of only 10 people in the world that can solve this problem?
  * Market 20%/year: Is the market growing 20%/year?
  * Product: Is the product 10x better than the competition?
  * Acquisition: Can I get user acquisition cost down to $0?
  * Monopoly: As the company grows, does it get stronger?
  
  Likelihoods explained
  
   * Won't have: This advantage is very unlikely/impossible to happen.
   * Can have: This advantage could maybe occur.
   * Have: I already have this advantage.
