title: A Call for Preregistration of Questionable Research Practices
---
Science is facing a replication crisis. I am calling for the preregistration of studies. Specifically, which questionable research practices the researchers intend to use. Researchers will submit their hypothesis (or lack thereof) and chosen method of manipulation (p-hacking, HARKing, cherry-picking etc). Completion of preregistration will guarantee non-publication in participating journals. There should also be a similar process for industry.

A new category of Questionable Research Practice (QRP) is emerging: the Meta-QRP. There is evidence that researchers are choosing their QRPs in unreliable ways. Examples include increasing the complexity of QRP selection models to improve training set fit (irregularization), presenting post hoc QRP selection as a priori (QHARKING), and running many QRPs while only presenting one with statistical significance (fish-hacking).

My belief is that by having researchers commit their QRPs to the blockchain (white paper coming) we can dramatically reduce the harmful effects of Meta-QRPs. A decentralized solution will allow greater scale and reach. For example, an employee can declare to their coworkers under which conditions they will pretend their experiment never happened.

Please join me in putting an end to Meta-QRPs.
